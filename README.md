# Spotify Gnome Widget

A widget for GNOME Shell (40.0). Displays information in the topbar about the song currently playing in Spotify. The user can also skip, toggle playback and restart the current song.

## Installation

You can either install the extension per-user in

    ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/

or machine-wide in
  
    /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
  
For installing this extension to the current user, copy the repository to the GNOME Shell extensions directory.

    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
    git clone https://github.com/rpmm/spotify_gnome_widget
  
Restart GNOME Shell (Press Alt+F2 and enter r) or logout and then log back in. You need to enable the extension (via e.g. the GNOME Tweaks Tool).

## Disclaimer

This extension is very WIP and tailored for my own setup!
